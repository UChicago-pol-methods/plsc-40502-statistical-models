With regard to the incompatibility, the agreement establishes a new government, after a process of ousting the existing government, and provides for the formation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. In 1992, the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan was overthrown by Mujahideen forces. Former President Najibullah Ahmadzai resigned on 16 April and the Mujaddidi was installed on 28 April.

A number of warring factions and the government of Afghanistan signed the Islamabad Accord on 7 March 1993.

The agreement stipulated an immediate ceasefire, and a permanent cessation of hostilities as soon as a new cabinet for Afghanistan had been put into place. A joint commission comprised of all of the signatory factions and the Organization of the Islamic Conference was created in order to monitor the ceasefire and the permanent cessation of hostilities.

One of the most important issues agreed upon in the accord was the formation of a 16-member defense council, composed of two delegates each from all of the eight signatory factions. The defense council was given the mandate to create a new national army, and to ensure the submission of the armed forces to the said council. Also, the defense council would be responsible for taking control of the heavy weapons deployed around Kabul.

The most important regulation of the incompatibility was the creation of a powersharing arrangement in the form of a transitional government (with a mandate for 18 months) in which Rabbani would remain as President and under which Hekmatyar (Hez-I-Islami) would assume the office of Prime Minister. The Cabinet was to be formed through consultations between the signatory parties in the time following the agreement. Further the agreement outlined the divisions of power between the Prime Minister and the President.Also, the parties agreed to hold elections not later than 18 months following on 29 December 1992. The elections process would be implemented by an independent Elections Commission, comprised of delegates from the warring parties. The goal of this process was to create a Grand Constituent Assembly that in turn would form and ratify a new constitution for Afghanistan.

The accord also contained provisions for the release of all Afghan detainees and prisoners held by the different parties to the conflict.

The accord stipulated a permanent ceasefire, which came into force on 23 May, and was to be monitored by a multiparty commission.

The Memorandum of Understanding on Peace and National Reconciliation in Cabinda province was signed after some months of much debated negotiations. Antonio Bento Bembe, who signed the agreement as a representative of CFD (Cabinda Forum for Dialogue) was not acknowledged as a legitimate negotiator by the main body of CFD. The unified FLEC split along former FAC-Renovada lines, with the former rejecting Bembe, saying that he had in fact been dismissed of his functions in the organisation already in February, and the latter supporting him. 

The agreement included provisions for a ceasefire, demilitarization of the CFD controlled areas and a reduction in the number of Angolan armed forces in Cabinda. 

The incompatibility was regulated by the installation of a local government with political and economical powers under the control of the central government in Luanda. Cabinda would have a ""special status"". Exactly what that status would be was not yet determined. However, it was clear that FLEC would get the right to name a government minister without portfolio, three deputy ministers (petroleum, interior and forestry), a deputy governor and some deputy provincial dictatorships. In Angolas state oil company, Sonangol, it would get two non-executive directors, a deputy director for Cabinda and three administrative advisers. 

The accord also stipulated a blanket amnesty to the rebels, and the reinsertion of the former rebels into society.","Angolan minister for Territorial Administration, Virgilio de Fontes Pereira and Antonio Bento Bembe","Dyadic peace agreement

Many went as far as to say that Bembe was in fact on the governments payroll. The ones supporting Bembe and the agreement appeared to be members of FLEC-Renovada. The latter joined with their former protagonists FLEC-FAC in 2004, but in 2006 the unified FLEC split over negotiations and it is probably more correct to see the peace agreement as being agreed by the government and FLEC-R, rather than CFD.

The Bicesse Accords were signed in Lisbon, Portugal, on 31 May 1991, and was a comprehensive peace agreement signed by the government of Angola and UNITA under the mediation of Portugal. The agreement accepted as binding a number of other documents, most importantly the Protocol of Estoril, a ceasefire agreement, the Fundamental Principles for the Establishment of Peace in Angola and the Concepts for Resolving the Issues Still Pending between the Government of the Peoples Republic of Angola and UNITA.

The first issue in the agreement was the establishment of a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities between the government and UNITA. The ceasefire covered the entire territory and entailed that the parties would refrain from importing lethal equipment, cease all types of attacks and sabotage and stop the spreading of hostile propaganda. The ceasefire was to be monitored by a joint commission, comprised of the two warring parties and a number of third party actors. See Third Parties for more information on this Joint Political-Military Commission.

Further, the agreement stipulated reforms of the military and security sector, creating an integrated army and a new police force. In the military sector the agreement stipulated that both parties would contribute 20 000 troops each to the new armed forces. In the security sector vacancies within the police force would be guaranteed for UNITA members in order to build confidence between the parties. The forces that were not integrated into the new army were to be demobilized and reintegrated into civilian life.

The agreement regulated the incompatibility through allowing UNITA to become a legal political party and through agreeing to hold elections in a multi-party democracy. UNITA was to become a political party, and freely take part in political activities now allowed under a revised constitution for Angola. An elections process was to be held in which the people would vote for a new president and a National Assembly. Political rights were extended, such as the freedom of expression and freedom of association. The authority of the central administration was extended to include the entire Angolan territory.

The implementation of the peace agreement became the responsibility of a joint political-military commission, comprised of the warring parties and third party actors. See Third Parties for further specifications. All civilian and military prisoners were to be released as a consequence of the agreement.

The Lusaka Protocol, the text being agreed upon on 15 November but not signed until 20 November, was a comprehensive peace agreement signed by both warring parties in Lusaka, Zambia, under the mediation of the United Nations. The agreement aimed to implement and to some extent amend the earlier Bicesse Accords of 1991.

The agreement reinstated the ceasefire from 1991, but contained some important amendments. Among other things this ceasefire agreement included the withdrawal of UNITA forces from specific locations to allow for a UN monitoring and verification presence in these areas. UNITA forces would withdraw to encampment areas, while government forces, in turn, would remain in situ. Regarding the military the agreement reaffirmed the provisions of the Bicesse Accords, meaning that there would be a proportionate integration of UNITA forces into the new national army. The agreement amended the earlier deal on the police forces, stipulating a specific number of UNITA troops that would become police officers in the new police force. A demobilization program was created under which military forces were to be demobilized and integrated into civilian society, within the framework of a national social reintegration program to be undertaken by both parties with the assistance of the international community. The ceasefire, the formation of the new armed forces and the demobilization would be monitored and verified by a joint commission and the UN. See Third Parties for further specifications.

The incompatibility was regulated under a framework for National Reconciliation, which entailed a power-sharing arrangement between the two warring factions. In practice this meant that UNITA were to participate in all levels of government, and that the movement was given certain ministerial portfolios, diplomatic missions, governorships and assured participation in the National Assembly. The framework of National Reconciliation also entailed promises to adhere to the rule of law, the censorship of hostile propaganda and an attempt to speed up the electoral process. Also, there was a decentralization of authority, bestowing provinces with more far-reaching self-governing powers in fields such as taxation, economy and administration.

The agreement also provided UNITA with a formal amnesty for crimes committed during the conflict, and supplied the UNITA party and political leaders with appropriate housing.","Angolas Foreign Minister, Venancio de Moura, signed for the government and UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola signed for the rebel movement.

The agreement reaffirmed a ceasefire and the withdrawal of UNITA troops to quartering locations for demobilization and integration into the national army. The agreement specified the exact numbers of troops to be integrated into the new military and police forces, including high-level posts such as generals and commanding officers. It also reaffirmed the provisions for demobilized troops to be integrated into normal social life and drew up a timetable for the final demobilization of these forces. A mixed commission was created to oversee the last stages of demobilization and reintegration of the demobilized troops. The agreement finally reaffirmed the UN presence and its mission in Angola. See Third Parties in Lusaka Protocol (1994) for further details on this mission.

The incompatibility was regulated through the agreements reached in the Lusaka Protocol of 1994, with UNITA participation in all levels of government through the appointment to high-ranking posts and ministerial portfolios.

The formal amnesty issued under the Lusaka Protocol was also reaffirmed.","Signed by UNITA Chief of Staff of FALA General Geralso Abreu Kamarteiro the Head of FAA, General Armando da Cruz Neto

A full peace agreement was signed in Dhaka on 2 December 1997 between the National Committee on the Chittagong Hill Tracts, representing the government of Bangladesh, and the JSS rebels.

The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and instead directly dealt with other military issues and political incompatibilities. The JSS rebels are to completely disarm, and are to be reintegrated into normal civilian life. In order to provide such rehabilitation into normal life JSS members and their families are given a lump sum of money. Also, JSS members that were employed in the state administration were allowed to be reinstated in their former positions. After the rehabilitation of all JSS members the government troops were to withdraw to permanent military installations in order to normalize the situation. Regarding internal security (police) the created regional council was given the powers over these forces.

The main provision in the accord was the creation of a CHT regional council with a range of autonomous responsibilities, where the chairman was to enjoy the rank of a state minister. 15 of 22 seats in the regional council, including the chairman, were reserved for tribal leaders, thus guaranteeing tribal control over traditional land. Changes in Bangladesh law were required to enable the establishment of the council, but anticipating criticism or misrepresentation of the accord, the issue of the sovereignty and integrity of Bangladesh was explicitly recognized. The transitional period following the signing of the treaty was to end with the withdrawal of the Bangladesh army from the region by the beginning of 2001.A general amnesty was given to all members of the JSS, as well as members of Shanti Bahini in return for surrender of their arms.

Further, a land reform was enacted in order to redistribute land between the Chittagong Hill Tribes and Bengali settlers and to solve disputes between these two groups. A number of funds and loan schemes were set up to facilitate the growth of economic enterprises, such as rubber plantations. A deal was also struck regarding internal refugees and their return to the Hill Tracts, under which the JSS was to cooperate in every aspect with the government. India was also involved in this repatriation of refugees, since many refugees had relocated to the Indian state of Tripura. See Third Parties for further comments.

The governments main opposition; the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) rejected the accord, saying it was against the unitary constitution and the interest of the Bengali-speaking settlers. On the other side at least three smaller groups in the Chittagong Hill Tracts; the Hill Students Federation, the Hill Peoples council and the Hill Womens council challenged at the time JSS role as the sole representative of the tribal people. Former associates to the JSS/SB leadership have later formed the United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF), which has continued a struggle for full autonomy. The amnesty was not extended to army and police personnel, but there was no commitment in the accord that past human rights violations by the law-enforcement personnel or Bengali settler groups close to the army.","Abdul Hasnat Abdullah, chief whip of the ruling Awami League in Jatiya Sangsad, convener of the National Committee on Chittagong Hills Tracts, signed the deal on behalf of the government.

This agreement is primarily an implementation of modalities of the Vance-Own plan and provides for the implementation of earlier agreements.  

The agreement provides for a cessation of hostilities to take effect on 19 May, for the withdrawal of forces, and the organization of a joint command to integrate armed forces under the administration of a joint Military Council. Prisoners are to be released. 

With regard to the incompatibility, a key component of the agreement was the creation and modalities for implementation of a provisional government. Local administration delegations are specified for Mostar, Travnik, and Zenica, with membership split between population groups. It also creates a ""well-balanced central government"", that is to be proposed to represent the signatory and other parties.

The belligerents in the Bosnia and Herzegovina – Croatian conflict signed the peace agreement in Washington on 1 March 1994, creating a framework agreement for a solution to the territorial conflict, creating a federation of Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a preliminary confederation between the Federation and Croatia.

The agreement contains an arrangement of disengagement for the transitional period, specifying that the armed forces of the disputing parties are to disengage to a safe distance from each other. All foreign armed forces are to leave the territory immediately. It is further agreed that after the transitional period the entities will form a unified military command for the national defense of the Federation.

The key issue of the agreement, which regulated the incompatibility, was the creation of a Federation, comprised of both Bosniak and Croat dominated territorial entities. The arrangements reached created a Federation in which Bosniaks and Croats shared power equally through a rotating presidency based on ethnicity, an equal representation of the two ethnic groups in the assembly and an equal proportion of judges in the judicial branches. Further, the agreement stipulated a division of the Federation into cantons that would have far-reaching self-governing powers in sectors such as policing, culture, education and taxation. These cantons were based on a system of ethnic dominance, creating Bosnian and Croat cantons throughout the territory. The central government would have exclusive responsibility for foreign affairs, national defense, economic policy and other issues not delegated to the cantonal governments. The emerging federal institutions were to operate parallel during the interim period.

The agreement also provided for a full repatriation of all refugees and internally displaced persons. Furthermore, a preliminary agreement was made between President Izetbegovic and President Tudjman, providing for the creation of an eventual loose confederation between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The peace agreement was further specified and implementation initiated in May. On 11 May, the Vienna Agreement divided the Federation into eight cantons and determined the composition of the interim federation government. On 31 May, the assembly of the Bosnian Federation elected an interim president (Kresimir Zubak, Croat) and a vice-president (Ejup Ganic, Bosniak). A joint government of (the old) Bosnia and Herzegovina and the (new) Federation was appointed in late June. The federal elections were scheduled after six months. On 4 May 1995, the inaugural session of the Federations Constituent Assembly took place. On 10 November 1995, comprehensive peace negotiations concerning several of the Yugoslav conflicts took place in Dayton, USA. Tudjman and Izetbegovic then signed an accord reinforcing the 1994 federation agreement. The new agreement included a provision for the unification of the divided city of Mostar as the federal capital.","Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian Croat representative Kresimir Zubak, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic","Comprehensive peace agreement

The comprehensive peace negotiations starting on 1 November in Dayton, USA, led up to the signing of a peace agreement. The Dayton Agreement was based on the accords reached in Geneva and in New York in September. See Negotiations for further details.

The agreement reaffirmed earlier ceasefire arrangements from September 14 and October 15, and also stipulated further withdrawals of military forces. The active armed forces were to withdraw from territory that was to fall under the political control of other political entities, and a Zone of Separation was created, disengaging the warring parties from each other. This Zone of Separation, and the ceasefire in general, was to be monitored by IFOR and a joint military commission created for that purpose. The UN group UNPROFOR was to withdraw and be replaced by IFOR (the Implementation Force under NATO control. For more information on IFOR’s and UNPROFOR’s mission, consult Third Parties to this agreement. Further, the agreement contained a number of arrangements regarding restrictions on heavy weapons, the disbandment of paramilitary groups and the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from the disputed territory.

The key agreement regulating the incompatibility was the amendment of the Bosnia and Herzegovina territorial and political structure, creating a new entity composed of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska; a Serb dominated territory. The Federation was to maintain its powers in the spheres of foreign policy, monetary policy and international obligations (among other things), whilst the entities received far-reaching provisions for self-government. Amongst other things the Republika Sprska received powers over law enforcement, the power to establish relationships with neighboring states and the power to make its laws. Yet it was agreed that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Bosnia was to be upheld. The new constitution entailed power-sharing arrangements at the level of central government, assuring the Serbs one third of delegates in the House of Peoples and the House of Representatives and a tripartite Presidency composed of one Serb, one Croat and one Bosniak. It was also agreed that elections were to be held throughout the territory under the auspices of an OSCE presence.

Deals were also struck regarding the strengthening of human rights, and the return of refugees and displaced persons. The return of refugees was ensured through a comprehensive program on their safe return, protection and judicial rights. Returnees were awarded with an amnesty (had they not committed serious violations) and were given repatriation assistance. Furthermore a fund was set up to facilitate the return of the displaced, and guidelines for the repossession of property or reimbursement were drawn up. ","Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic,

The Vance-Own Plan resulted from negotiations hosted by UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance and EC representative Lord Owen between the warring parties in Bosnia. 

The plan proposed dividing Bosnia into semi-autonomous regions and had backing from the UN. The plan outlined a constitutional framework, proposing a decentralized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina with three constituent peoples and composed of locally governed provinces. The presidency of the central government was to be composed of three elected representatives, one to each of the constituent peoples. 

The plan included three separate documents - the Agreement relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Agreement for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Agreement on Interim Arrangements - which further outlined cooperative measures to be taken in the interest of a cessation of hostilities and for humanitarian efforts. Attached Annexes outlined dimensions of these priorities. Annex I included provisions for a ceasefire, including a timeline and provision of a peacekeeping operation, UN Protection Force/European Community Monitoring Mission. Annex II, on restoration of infrastructure, prioritized cooperation for civil infrastructure in Sarajevo and throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, including through the creation of bodies to implement and oversee such efforts. Annex III opened routes for humanitarian access, including through the creation of the Sarajevo ""blue route"" concept. Annexes four and five provided for a separation of forces and demilitarization of Sarajevo, respectively. Annex six detailed border monitoring principles and annex seven provided for a return of forces to their designated positions. Finally, an attached agreement on interim arrangements provided for an interim presidency, central government, and provincial governments, including designating integration of all signatory parties in government and civil service an designation of seats in executive positions for shared government. Provisions for the protection of human rights and reversal of ethnic cleansing stipulated the creation of a Human Rights Court for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be created, along with other implementing and monitoring bodies.

This declaration is an agreement to continue negotiations between the warring parties in Burundi. The agreement resulted from the first session of negotiations, hosted by Tanzania. The agreement primarily commits the parties to a future round of negotiations and sets the agenda for the talks. They also declare a suspension of hostilities to take place from 20 July 1998. The means of implementation for the suspension of hostilities are delegated to future negotiations. 

With regard to the incompatibility, this agreement states the parties' determination to create ""conditions for peaceful coexistence on the basis of democratic values and security for all"" and to undertake negotiations to find a just solution. The agenda items set speak to general themes around the incompatibility, namely commitment to address democracy, good governance issues and related systems. 

The parties state (1) they are committed to resolve the conflict by peaceful means and to end all forms of violence, (2) they commit to resume peace talks within a month, (3) they set the agenda for comprehensive negotiations, and (4) they appoint committees to address the agenda items. Parties also agree that the inclusion of civil society in the talks should be continued. ","Annex I:

Despite disagreements on key issues during Arusha negotiations, an agreement was signed on 28 August 2000. Three of the parties signed in September. All in all, 19 parties acceded to the agreement, including the former warring parties CNDD, FROLINA and PALIPEHUTU. However, both the CNDD-FDD and the FNL denounced the peace agreement.

The agreement firstly stipulated a ceasefire and a cessation of all hostile attacks, acts of violence against civilians, the supply of armaments and an end to hostile propaganda. The ceasefire entailed no concessions of territory, and all troops remained in situ, or were to be encamped in prearranged sites to await demobilization or integration into the new armed forces. A joint ceasefire commission was created in order to monitor and supervise the ceasefire and was composed of government delegates, members of the warring parties, the United Nations, the OAU and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi. See Third Parties for more details on this commission. The encampment of the warring parties was to be followed by a general demobilization for those forces that were not incorporated into the restructured armed forces. The parties agreed to reform the armed forces on the basis of an ethnic quota, stating that the armed forces would be composed of 50% Hutus and 50% Tutsis. The same modality was provided for the security forces, providing an equal proportion of employment vacancies for the ethnic groups within the police force. For those not incorporated into these new branches of the armed forces a demobilization package was created with the purpose of providing socio-professional training to those demobilized

The peace agreement also provided for arrangements for a pre-transition, and then transition, period, which would be followed by democratic elections. The transitional period contained elements of a power-sharing arrangement, assuring the signatories and members of the civil society seats in a transitional National Assembly. A created Senate would be elected on an ethnic basis, ensuring ethnic balance in the higher levels of government. A range of procedures for the assembly and the senate were agreed upon, to ensure that no single political or ethnic group could receive a complete domination of the political system. The agreement further contained a number of amendments to the political and judicial system, all with the goal of creating a democratic state with the traits associated with good governance. An Implementation Verification Commission was created to oversee and supervise the implementation of the provisions of the agreement.

The transitional period was to end with elections for the National Assembly, the Presidency and the Senate according to the principles of free and fair elections.

Certain provisions for demobilization were given, the most important being demobilization allowances for all demobilized troops, and a general amnesty applicable to all those who had not committed crimes against humanity or crimes relating to the genocide.

Reconstruction and development, and the return of refugees and displaced persons were important issues in the agreement, and extensive reconstruction programs for economic and social development were formed, as well as an extensive program for the resettling of those uprooted by the conflict.

The agreement also stipulated the creation of a number of commissions and committees, charged with the responsibilities of investigate alleged crimes of genocide, explore ways to reach National Reconciliation and to administer ethnic harmony.","Ambrosie Niyonsaba for the government of Burundi, Léonce Ngendakumana for the National Assembly, Térence Nsanze for ABASA, Patrice Nsababaganwa for ANADDE, André Nkundikije for AV-INTWARI, Léonard Nyangoma for CNDD, Jean Minani for FRODEBU, Joseph Karumba for FROLINA, Alphose Rugambarara for INKINZO, Etiénne Karatasi for PALIPEHUTU, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza for PARENA, Nicéphore Ndimurukundo for PIT, Gaëtan Nikobamye for PL, Shadrack Niyonkuru for PP, Mathias Hitimana for PRP, Godefroy Hakizimana for PSD, Joseph Nzeyimana for RADDES, Balthazar Bigirimana for RPB and Libère Bararunyeretse for UPRONA.","Dyadic peace agreement

The Ceasefire Agreement between the Transitional Government of Burundi and CNDD-FDD brought the CNDD-FDD into the Arusha Accords process, which the rebel group had opposed in 2000. Most of the implementation process was specified under the Arusha Accords, and the agreement can be seen as a continuation of a process begun under that agreement.

The conflict behavior of the parties was regulated through the establishment of a ceasefire, which stipulated a withdrawal of forces from the frontline to assembly areas. The ceasefire further entailed the release of all prisoners, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and a cessation of all hostile acts, both practical and verbal. A joint commission, comprised of the warring parties and the African mission, was set up to implement and verify the ceasefire.

Further, rebel troops were to be integrated into the national army, or be demobilized. The modalities for these actions were specified in the Arusha Accords from the year 2000. CNDD-FDD forces were to integrate into both the army and the security forces. The agreement reiterated the need for reintegration and rehabilitation programs.

The incompatibility was regulated through allowing the CNDD-FDD to become a legal and valid political party, and through allowing them to take part in a power-sharing arrangement within the Burundian political structure. The structure of this power-sharing arrangement, and other outstanding issues were to be agreed upon at a later stage in negotiations, but would be in the form of an inclusive transitional government.","President Pierre Buyoya, representative of the CNDD-FDD Pierre Nkurunziza

The government of Burundi and the CNDD-FDD signed this agreement on 8 October 2003, to resolve some of the outstanding issues that were listed, but not regulated, in the agreement reached on 2 December 2002. 

The agreement contained no ceasefire arrangements, seeing that these issues had already been resolved. The key issues were instead power-sharing arrangements in the political and military spheres. 

Concerning the military forces the agreement specifies a 60/40 quota of General Staff and Officer Corps to be shared between the government and the CNDD-FF. The quota for the rank and file is to be agreed upon by the integrated General Staff. A similar quota is applied for the police force, with 65% for the transitional government, and 35% for the CNDD-FDD. The new police force would be guided by the principles of inclusion and integration and ethnicity was to be balanced. The Gendarmerie would be treated as part of the army. Elements of the Gendarmerie may be deployed to either the new defense or police forces. Militias would be disarmed according to the December 2002 Ceasefire Agreement under the supervision of the African Mission. The parties also agreed on the establishment of a Ministry of Intelligence under the Presidency. The composition of the Ministry would give the government 65% representation and the CNDD-FDD 35% representation, and it would be ethnically balanced in the same manner as the police force.In the political sphere extensive powersharing arrangements were formed, with CNDD-FDD participation at most levels of government. The main provisions in this sphere were that the CNDD-FDD secured four ministerial posts, one of which is that of Minister of State. CNDD-FDD will also have the posts of Second Vice President and Deputy Secretary General and 15 members in the National Assembly and at provincial and local government level, three Governors, 30 Administrators and five Advisors. In addition the CNDD-FDD secured a 20% representation in Burundian public enterprises; they were given two ambassadorships and six advisors’ posts within the Diplomatic Corps.

Other outstanding issues were to be discussed at a later stage.","For the Transitional Government of Burundi,His Excellency Domitien: Ndayizeye, President of the Republic of Burundi

On 2 November a partial peace agreement, solving the outstanding issues of the 8 October agreement, was signed in Pretoria between CNDD-FDD (Nkurunziza) and the government.The agreement reaffirmed the ceasefire agreement signed on 2 December 2002 and called for the continuation of the process of cantonment of the military. The specifications for the integration of CNDD-FDD forces into the Burundian armed forces were reaffirmed, providing the CNDD-FDD with power-sharing arrangements in the military sphere (see 2003-08-10 for further details regarding the integration). A detailed plan for military restructuring, cantonment and demobilization was also drawn up in the form of a forces technical agreement.

Further it was stipulated that the transitional government of Burundi would be reconstituted within three weeks following the agreement to include the CNDD-FDD. The CNDD-FDD would also be transformed into a political party, and its members would receive temporary immunity. Another important political issue was the indication from the CNDD-FF that they would not be able to participate in the transitional senate, and that this complication would be discussed before the elections.

The parties also agreed to call for a national and inclusive dialogue to bring the conflict to a speedy end. Finally there would be established an International Criminal Tribunal and a National Truth and Reconciliation Commission in order to deal with war criminals and the process of national reconciliation.","His Exellency Domitien Ndayizeye President of the Republic of Burundi

The FTA referenced both the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement and the Ceasefire Agreement signed between the same parties on the same dates. 

Regarding the incompatibility, the FTA regulated the roles and principles for the new armed forces of Burundi in complement to the Pretoria Protocol on Political, Defence and Security. The agreement specified that members of the army and the police were not to be affiliated to political parties or any other organisation of a political nature, although they may exercise their civil right to vote in elections. Members of CNDD-FDD were to be integrated into the armed forces but so as to keep the ethnic diversity within Arusha, the agreement stipulates that  Burundi National Defence Force (BNDF) shall not consist of more than 50% of any of the ethnic groups.","For the Transitional Government of Burundi, His Excellency Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the Republic of Burundi

The agreement brought the CNDD-FDD into the Arusha process, leaving only Palipehutu-FNL outside the peace deals. One should view this agreement as the finalization of a process that begun with the Arusha Accords in 2000.

The Global Ceasefire agreement reaffirmed the earlier agreements reached, and thus provided the CNDD-FDD with extensive powersharing arrangements in both the military/security sector and the political sector. Further details can be found in the partial peace agreements leading up to this finalized deal, but the most important provisions granted to the CNDD-FDD were a 40% share in the army, a 35% share in the police, several ministerial portfolios and other government posts and 20% of Burundian national enterprises.

Reforms are stipulated for executive, legislative, and judicial systems as well as constitutional and security sector reforms. These steps are aimed at establishing national unity and reconciliation and political, economic, and social inclusivity and stability.

These aspects are further extended to ensure participation of women and guarantee minority rights in the political process. Legal principles seek to include minority political parties, and percentages for seats in government are to reflect ethnic balances. Specific seat percentages are detailed, especially with respect to designating a balance to exist between Hutu and Tutsis in government systems at national and municipal levels. The National Assembly, as agreed in Arusha, was to have 60-40 power sharing between Hutu and Tutsi, with 3 members of Twa ethnicity and 30% of members to be women. ","(Signatures illegible)

This was the first ever agreement signed by the Palipehutu-FNL and the government. The agreement contained nine articles and two annexes and negotiations took place between 29 May and 18 June.

The parties agreed to stop all hostilities and start negotiations on a comprehensive ceasefire. From the start of the ceasefire the agreement provided for provisional immunity of members of the Palipehutu-FNL and for the relese of political prisoners and prisoners of war. Regarding the Defence and Security Forces they were to act in a manner fostering national reconciliation and national unity, they were to be subject to the national agenda in Burundi for democracy, peace, justice, reconciliation, security, stability, development and prosperity. 

Regarding the incompatibility Palipehutu-FNL was allowed to become a political party after the separation of the political and the military branch of the movement. A Truth, Forgiveness and Reconciliation Commission would be formed by all components of the Burundian society with the aim of rewriting the Burundian history and establish a social contract. 

The agreement provided for the repatriation of refugees and return of the displaced and regrouped people. The Regional Initiative should be guarantors of the peace process and ensure the security of the repatriated persons.","For the government of Burundi: H.E. Evariste Ndayishimiye

The Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement between the Palipehutu-FNL and the government of Burundi was signed in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on 7 September 2006 following negotiations since the end of May, which also lead up to the signing of the ""Agreement of Principles Towards Lasting Peace, Security and Stability"", a peace process agreement of which this agreement is the final outcome. 

The agreement consisted of six articles and four annexes.

The agreement stipulated a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities, to be monitored and verified by the JVMM (Joint Verification and Monitoring Mechanism), which was to be consisted of the AU, the UN and the warring parties. This mechanism was responsible for the assembly of Palipehutu-FNL combatants and their demobilisation, creation of criteria for integration into the army, or the reintegration into society of ex-combatants.

Regarding the incompatibility the parties agreed to cease all propaganda between the parties and the incitement of ethnic hatred both within and outside the country. One of the main obstacles for Palipehutu-FNL with previous peace processes in the country has been reform of the Burundian armed forces. Therefore one of the main points of the agreement (which to a certain degree regulated the incompatibility) was to further outline the stipulated reform of the Defense and Security forces, a process that was begun in the peace process agreement signed in June the same year. 

Other important points in the agreement were the granting of provisional immunity to Palipehutu-FNL combatants, which was implemented in November 2006, the release of prisoners and calls for the repatriation of all refugees and IDPs to their places of residence.","For Burundi: President Pierre Nkurunziza

The agreement represented a solution to the final outstanding issues in the peace process between the parties, namely the issue of removal of ethnic references from Palipehutu-FNL’s name and integration of members of the organisation into government. 

The agreement was signed during a one-day summit involving heads of state in the Great Lakes region and other stakeholders in the peace process. The summit was presided over by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Chairperson of the regional Burundi Peace Initiative.

In the agreement, Palipehutu-FNL acknowledged that its name was prohibited by the Burundian Constitution and agreed to change it in order to be able to register as a political party. The government agreed to integrate Palipehutu-FNL into the political process and to grant government positions to 33 of its senior members. The agreement thus regulated the incompatibility by removing the final obstacles for the transformation of Palipehutu-FNL into a political party and granting it participation in government. 

The parties also reaffirmed their commitment to the demobilisation process, monitored by the joint verification monitoring mechanism (JVMM), and release of political prisoners outlined in the 2006 agreement.","For the Government of Burundi: H.E. Pierre Nkurunziza

On 23 October the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict was signed between the government of Cambodia and the three groups fighting the government (the Khmer Rouge, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF). The agreement is also referred to as ‘the Paris Agreement’, since it was signed in Paris, France, during a peace conference held by the government of the French Republic.The agreement firstly reaffirms a number of earlier agreements, such as the Framework document of 28 August 1990, the formation of the Supreme National Council (SNC) on 10 September 1990 and the election of Prince Sihanouk as the President of the SNC on 17 July 1991.

A ceasefire is called into place, which ends hostilities between the parties. The ceasefire also stipulates the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Cambodian territory, and the cessation of all military support to the belligerents in the conflict. The parties agreed to demobilize all of their forces before the elections, and to place any units that were not demobilized under the control of the government that would be elected after the transitional period. A new national army was to be formed to the end the conflict. The training and restructuring of the police force was delegated to the UNTAC mission.

One of the most important measures for regulating the incompatibility was the formation of the Supreme National Council which was lead by Prince Sihanouk. This council was the outcome of a power-sharing arrangement between the parties under which power would be split almost equally between the belligerents. The SNC was to be seen as the sole representative of Cambodian sovereignty and authority. The SNC was composed of 6 members of the Cambodian government, 2 members of KPNLF, 1 member of FUNCINPEC and 2 members of the Khmer Rouge (KR). An important issue was the provision to hold free and fair elections at the end of the transitional period. The elections were supposed to end the conflict. Principles for a new constitution were elaborated upon, and would include a strengthening of human rights and democracy.

A substantive role was played by the UN and the UNTAC mission stationed in Cambodia to oversee the ceasefire and the transitional period. See Third Parties for more specifications.

The agreement also stipulated the release of all political prisoners, civilian internees and prisoners of war. Likewise there was an extensive program for the return of refugees and displaced persons, for which the government of Cambodia asked for the assistance of the UN and the international community.",,"Comprehensive peace agreement

The Final Colombian Peace Agreement resulted from meetings that took place between the Government and FARC, with support from Norway and Cuba and with Venezuela and Chile as observers, in Havana between 23 February and 26 August 2012, and from a revision of the peace agreement following a plebiscite in August 2016. The plebiscite presented a peace agreement to the people, which they voted down. In response, the Government and FARC, together with representatives of civil society and other interested parties, made changes to produce a new, final agreement. The final agreement resolved all outstanding issues. It includes a gender approach and wide-reaching considerations for fulfillment of human rights, and includes provisions for comprehensive rural reform, political participation, a definitive ceasefire between the two groups, DDR processes, security guarantees, a solution to the illicit drugs problems, reparations for victims, and implementation and verification mechanisms. It referenced the previous agreements signed 26 August 2012 and 24 August 2016. 

Regarding the incompatibility, the agreement granted the FARC political status, and provided for greater, more balanced political and civil participation in government structures and processes. Provisions are made throughout the agreement for balanced representation, local power, transparent processes, and active civilian participation in governing. The agreement also addressed underlying issues of the conflict, including through the rural reform and solution to the illicit drugs provisions. 

The first chapter of the agreement addresses comprehensive rural reform. This chapter provides for reform of a Land Fund to promote equitable access to land; programs for transforming territorial planning into more participatory processes; and national plans for reform that prioritizes infrastructure and land improvement, irrigation, electricity connectivity, and social development (health, education, housing, and poverty eradication). The chapter establishes mechanisms for gender equality, emphasizes reaching and enforcing solutions through community-based systems, guaranteeing socio-environmental sustainability and well-being. 

The second chapter addresses political participation. It provides for the transformation of the FARC into a political party and includes provisions on rights and security for political opposition. It also extends democratic mechanisms for citizen participation, peaceful protest, reconciliation, and provides for measures to promote political pluralism, and reforms for transparency and equal access for participation in electoral processes. This chapter includes provisions for a gender-based approach. 

Chapter three includes provisions to end the conflict. It includes a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, as well as DDR processes, especially for reincorporation of former combatants into civilian life. Security, financial, access to media, and other guarantees are provided for, especially pertaining to newly created political parties and for civil society organizations for women, victims, and others. Relevant mechanisms, commissions, and monitoring bodies are established to realize each provision. Attention is paid to remedying corruption and containing criminal organizations. Reconciliation is advanced through the creation of the National Council for Reconciliation and Coexistence. 

Chapter four, Solution to the Illicit Drugs Problem, creates the National Comprehensive Programme for the Substitution of Crops Used for Illicit Purposes (NCPS) and provides for holistic transformation of the nation around the topic of illicit drugs, including enhanced security conditions and strengthened economic, social, and environmental well-being of communities affected by crops used for illicit drugs. Local-level and community-based plans and programs are specified for substitution of illicit crops. Provisions are also made for public health and drug use prevention programs, and for addressing the production and selling of narcotics. 

The fifth chapter is about victims of the conflict. It primarily outlines victims' rights and provides for truth and reconciliation processes, including the creation of the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparations and Non-Recurrence. The Comprehensive System has separate mechanisms dealing with truth, justice, reparations for victims, and guarantees for non-recurrence.

Chapter six includes principles and mechanisms for implementation, verification, and public endorsement of the Agreement. It includes the creation of the Commission for Monitoring, Promoting and Verifying the Implementation of the Final Agreement and provides for participatory and transparent processes, incorporation of ethnic perspectives, international verification, inclusion of an equity- and gender-based approach, and communication tools to educate the public.

The Famboni Declaration was a peace agreement signed in Famboni, by the central government of Comoros and the separatist leader of the island of Anjouan.The key issue agreed upon was the transformation of the political and territorial structure of the Comoros, granting extensive powers of self-government to the different islands that constitute this small country. The final political structure was unclear though, bearing traits of federal, confederal and autonomy solutions. It was specified that the central government would remain responsible for external defence, religion, nationality, monetary policy and foreign relations; but the exact powers delegated to the islands remained unclear.

The agreement also created a new constitution to be put to the vote at a referendum after the one year transitional period.The agreement was severely criticized by the OAU on the grounds that it contravened the Antananativo Agreement from 1999 (this agreement was never signed by the Anjouan separatists).

The Agreement for Peace and National Reconciliation was signed on 26 December 1994 in Djibouti. An immediate ceasefire was put into place, and a demobilization and reintegration of FRUD members would follow. The agreement stipulated that FRUD rebels were to be integrated into the military forces of Djibouti and an extensive program of DDR was drawn up to allow for this integration, and also for the reintegration of FRUD members into other sectors of society.

On the political level the key issues that were regulated were those of FRUD’s participation in the political life of Djibouti. On top of becoming a legal political party FRUD officials were to participate in the administration of state affairs. Also of importance was the recasting of the electoral rolls for the general elections that were to be held. Once the situation in Djibouti had returned to normal the agreement stipulated that there would be a countrywide decentralization of authority to make room for better governance of the state.

Extensive reintegration programs were agreed upon, charging the government of Djibouti with finding employment for those FRUD members who were not incorporated into the army.  All FRUD members who laid down there arms received a general amnesty.The government also agreed to channel funds to projects for the reconstruction of the country in order to rebuild damaged infrastructure and to assist refugees and the internally displaced.

The Framework Agreement for Civil Reform and Concord was signed on 7 February 2000 in Paris and can be seen as a supplement to the earlier accord of 1994, but also has the traits of a new, comprehensive, peace agreement. The earlier agreement ended the conflict with FRUD, and this deal was instead signed by a faction of that rebel organization.

The agreement stipulated a new ceasefire, under which government troops were made to withdraw to peacetime locations in the interest of normalizing the situation in Chad. A cessation of hostilities was instituted together with a joint mission to clear the conflict zone of mines. As in the 1994 agreement, FRUD – AD rebels became the subject of a DDR program, integrating FRUD – AD fighters into the national army, and other FRUD – AD members into civilian posts as deemed appropriate for them. Those who had suffered economic losses were to be compensated by the government.

The political provisions included a more far-reaching decentralization of authority and a move towards a more democratic Djibouti. The decentralization reform was supposed to give the provinces a broad autonomy to ensure better management of state affairs. The agreement also contained some reforms to make the political system more free, transparent and accountable, especially in terms of public spending.

Efforts to rebuild the country and encourage refugees and IDP’s to return were also a vital part of the agreement, and all those affected by the conflict were to receive appropriate compensation.

After 15 months of negotiations the Djibouti government and the radical wing of the opposition Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD – AD) signed a peace accord on 12 May. The accord ended hostilities that were launched at the start of 1990s by FRUD, a rebel movement of the Afars (second largest ethnic group in Djibouti after the Somali-speaking Issa). The agreement reaffirms the earlier agreements of 1994 (signed by the main body of FRUD) and 2000 (signed by FRUD – AD).

The agreement stipulated a ceasefire, under which both the FRUD – ADs and the government’s troops were to withdraw from the territory they occupied. The rebels were forced to withdraw to specified locations (such as Waddi) to await demobilization or integration into the national army. The government’s troops, in turn, were to relocate to peacetime locations and remain encamped in their barracks. As in the previous agreements between FRUD and the government, FRUD troops are to be integrated into the national army. It is important to note that the integration stipulated under this agreement concerned not only the army, but also assured FRUD – AD that its troops would be incorporated into a restructured police force.

There were three key issues in the political sphere of the agreement; namely the reaffirmation of FRUD’s transformation into a legal political party, further specifications of the nature of the decentralization of authority and the government’s acceptance of multi-party elections. 

A program for the repatriation of refugees and the reconstruction of war affected areas was also agreed upon.",The agreement was signed by Djibouti Interior Minister Abdallah Abdillahi Miguil and FRUD – C leader Ahmed Dini.,"Dyadic peace agreement

The Lusaka Accord was signed 10 July 1999 by the first parties. MLC signed the agreement on 1 August 1999 and RCD finally signed the accord on 31 August 1999. 

The first point in the agreement was a ceasefire, entailing a cessation of hostilities, an end to the movement of military forces and hostile propaganda and a redeployment to defensive positions. Further, it was specified that there would be a complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the DR Congo within 9 months. A joint military commission, comprised of the warring parties and the UN/OAU observer groups, would be set up to ensure compliance with the ceasefire and to disarm identified militia groups such as the Mayi-Mayi and Interahamwé. Furthermore, it established the deployment of UN peacekeepers and the formation of a national army made up by government and rebel forces.

A key issue was the organization of inter-Colongese political negotiations. The inter-Congolese dialogue would include the government along with the armed and unarmed political forces of the country, and lead to a democratic transition by general elections. 

The peace agreement also provided for amnesty for all rebel groups, apart from those implicated in acts of genocide.","President Laurent Kabila for the DRC, Minister of Defence Kundi Paihama for Angola, President Robert Mugabe for Zimbabwe, President Sam Numoja for Namibia, President Yoweri Museveni for Uganda, President Pasteur Bizimungu for Rwanda, rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba for the MLC, rebel leader Emile Ilunga and 41 of his deputies for the RCD and rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba and 7 of his deputies for the RCD-ML.","Comprehensive peace agreement

In September there were reports of continuous clashes and the parties accused each other of violating the agreement. Attacks were for example reported on 1 September 1999 at Bosange, Elongo, Mokono and Vuema. On 16 September RCD rejected Kabilas invitation to start the inter-Congolese dialouge provided for in the agreement. During the 18 months following the peace agreement, little progress in implementation was made. Fighting went on more or less continuously despite periodic ceasefires and intense diplomatic activity. At the same time, the Lusaka accord was still viewed by the various foreign parties as the basis for a peaceful settlement and their own eventual withdrawal.

Under this agreement a new national army would be formed comprising government, MLC and RCD, RCD-ML, RCD-N and the Mayi-Mayi forces. A working group to develop a transitional constitution for the country would be established.

The Political Agreement on Consensual Management of the Transition in the DRC provided for a national assembly, a senate, a senior army council, and courts and tribunals. The agreement accepted Joseph Kabila as president for the 30-month transitional period and allowed the MLC rebel leader Jean Pierre Bemba to become prime minister. The position of the president of the senate was offered to the political non-armed opposition parties, civil society the responsibility for organising elections, setting up a truth and reconciliation commission, and establishing a human rights, ethics and anti-corruption committee. The president would be supreme commander of the army to be controlled through a senior army council. The President would also guarantee the national unity and territorial integrity of the country.

The Global and Inclusive Agreement on the transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo was signed in Pretoria on 16 December 2002 during negotiations held by the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and included the warring parties, the political opposition and the ‘forces vives’ (civil society) of the DRC.

In this peace accord the parties reaffirmed the ceasefire modalities from the Lusaka Agreement, the Kampala Withdrawal Plan and the Harare Sub-Agreement in order to cease hostilities and to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict. The parties further agreed to form a restructured, integrated national army comprised of fighters from the different factions. A similar formula was applied to the police force, creating integrated units in the security sector as well. No exact quota is specified for each group, but the agreement states that the share will be equitable.

Political provisions of special interest are the agreements struck to reform the DRC’s political structure during and after a transitional period of 24 months. At the end of this transitional period elections were to be held. These reforms of the political structures contained a variety of power-sharing arrangements in which four vice presidents were appointed; one from the RCD, one from the MLC, one from the government and one from the political opposition. Kabila was allowed to remain in his presidential seat. Ministerial portfolios were also granted to the parties, each group receiving seven ministries and four deputy minister posts. A power-sharing formula was also applied to the senate and the national assembly, effectively granting a specific number of seats in these assemblies to all of the parties involved in the ICD. Reforms also included the separation of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.

A number of other issues were also elaborated upon, amongst others the granting of an amnesty to all those who had not committed acts of genocide, and an extensive program for the resettlement of those uprooted by the hostilities.","For the government of the DRC: Théophile Mbemba;

The military forces were agreed to be nonpolitical. The transition period is stated to be twenty-four months with exceptions for prolongation. 

With regard to the incompatibility, the transitional constitution specifies that the four posts of vice-president will be held by persons from the Government of the DRC, RCD, MLC, and the political opposition. It also states there should be balanced representation in government entities, specifically provincial representation and the inclusion of women in the National Assembly and Senate; national balance of power in the judiciary; and provincial balance of recruits for the national police and armed forces.

The Peace Agreement between the Government and CNDP (Ihussi Accord or 23 March 2009 Agreement) was concluded between the government of DR COngo and CNDP on 23 March 2009. The agreement came after most CNDP had been integrated into the national army in order to help the government and Rwanda to fight the Rwandan FDLR rebel group. 

The agreement recalled the ceasefire declared on 16 January and 4 February 2009. CNDP reaffirmed their commitment to integrate the members into the police and the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The parties also agreed on a far-reaching reform of the army and security services. The agreement provided for the creation of a community-based police service to reflect local social diversity. 

CNDP would be transformed into a political party, the CNDP officials would be integrated into national politics. CNDP would be able to participate in the political activities of DRC. The parties also agreed on an evaluation of the Electoral Act. The parties also reaffirmed the national sovereignty, territorial integrity, inviolability of national borders and the human rights and fundamental freedoms and duties of citizens and of the State as well as the Republican and apolitical nature of the armed forces and national police. The agreement also provided for the restoration of State authority in the areas of Masisi, Rutshuru and Nyiragongo. 

The government agreed to release all political prisoners and to promulgate an Amnesty Act covering the period from June 2003-2009, and which should be in compliance with international law. The government also committed itself to set up a ministerial body responsible for national security, local affairs and reconciliation. Local conciliation committees would be set up. The agreement provided for the return of displaced people and refugees to their countries and of IDPs to their communities.

The Mexico Agreements were a continuation of the peace process that began in Geneva on 4 April 1990, and regulated some of the issues outlined in that earlier agreement.

The main regulations of the incompatibility are reforms of the judicial and electoral system and alterations in the powers of the armed forces. The parties agreed on a clearer subordination of the armed forces to civilian authority, and to resolve the issue of paramilitary forces operating in the country.  A new State Intelligence Agency was to be formed and placed under the direct authority of the President of the Republic. Of importance was this agency’s total independence from the armed forces.

The judicial system was reformed in order to improve significant aspects of the judicial system and establishing mechanisms for safeguarding human rights. A new Supreme Electoral Tribunal was established to replace the Central Board of Elections. The goal in this instance was to make sure that no party of coalition could dominate the elections board. Other minor reforms were initiated to secure free and fair elections.

The first agreement signed in the renewed Guatemalan peace process, not counting the timetable agreement, was the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights, aimed at strengthening the proliferation of democratic values and respect for the individual throughout Guatemalan society.

The government agreed to adhere to the principles and norms of human rights, and to implement measures and institutions to promote and perfect these norms. The agreement also contained a commitment against impunity, and a commitment to abolish illegal security forces. In addition to this the government was charged with a purification and professionalization of its own security forces. Force conscription was also abolished. 

The United Nations was chosen to function as a verification mechanism, to receive and follow-up on alleged violations of human rights.","For the Government of the Republic of Guatemala Héctor ROSADA GRANADOS General Carlos Enrique PINEDA CARRANZA Antonio F.

This peace process agreement included four chapters outlining wide-ranging commitments to recognize the identity of indigenous peoples, to eliminate discrimination against them and to guarantee their cultural, civil, political, social and economic rights.The accord also established five commissions that were to allow for a strengthening of the groups rights of the indigenous people. The indigenous peoples were to gain recognition of their customary law, listing of indigenous languages as recognized, laws against discrimination, and incorporation of their cultural values and norms into the educational system. Also, land reforms were to be enacted to give land to the indigenous peoples and those who lack the right to own land.

The agreement also stated that there would be a devolution of powers from the state level to regional and municipal levels of government. The reform would enable the indigenous communities to manage their internal affairs within a framework of municipal authority. The powers were to include economic development, health, education and culture. Further there would be a strengthening, within the municipalities, of indigenous customary law to enable them to govern themselves through their own cultural norms.

This accord was unique in Latin-American history and received a cautious welcome from the Co-ordination of Organizations of Mayan People in Guatemala (COPMAGUA).","For the Government of the Republic of Guatemala: [Signed] Héctor ROSADA GRANADOS [Signed] Brigadier General Carlos Enrique PINEDA CARRANZA [Signed] Antonio ARENALES FORNO [Signed] Brigadier General Julio Arnoldo BALCONI TURCIOS [Signed] Mario PERMUTH [Signed] Brigadier General José Horacio SOTO SALAN [Signed] Rubén Amilcar BURGOS SOLIS [Signed] Manuel SALAZAR TETZAGUIC

This peace agreement, part of the renewed Guatemalan peace process, regulated the relationship between the armed forces and civilian authorities, and included far-reaching reforms of the said relationship.

One of the main provisions was that there would be reforms and a restructuring of the different branches of the armed forces. The first point was the restructuring of the police force into a new National Civil Police with a reformed mandate. The new police force should take into account the multi-ethnic character of Guatemala in its recruitment, but it did not assure URNG or the indigenous population any direct influence or participation. Further the army would limit its role to external defence and adjust its doctrine, training, development, size and budget accordingly. The Voluntary Civil Defence Committees (CVDC) and the mobile military police were to be disbanded and never again recreated for the purpose of internal security. The operations of private security firms would be regulated and forced conscription ended.

The agreement also reaffirmed and further elaborated upon the decentralization of authority to sub-national political entities. Finally it contained a comprehensive package of provisions relating to the strengthening of democratic government covering the legislature, executive and judiciary.","For the government of the Republic of Guatemala: Gustavo PORRAS CASTEJÓN Otto PÉREZ MOLINA Brigadier-General Raquel ZELAYA ROSALES Morris Eugenio de LEÓN GIL Colonel (Infantry) Richard AITKENHEAD CASTILLO

The agreement dealt solely with the ceasefire and the demobilization and reintegration of URNG members. The ceasefire entailed a withdrawal from the frontline of the government’s forces in order to create demilitarized zones. URNG forces were to withdraw to encampment sites to await disarmament and reintegration into society. An extensive package of DDR activities was agreed upon, with the aim of transforming the URNG into a legal political party. The exact modalities of the integration of URNG members into society were to be specified in a separate agreement.

The agreement provided for the resignation of Cédras and the appointment by Aristide of new armed forces and the adoption of a law creating a new police and the appointment of a new police chief by Aristide.
The incompatibility was going to be solved by Aristide’s return to Haiti on 30 October 1993. The appointment by Aristide of a new Prime Minister, the ratification of the Prime Minister’s appointment by a ”normal” Haitian National Assembly, the suspension of UN and OAS trade sanctions once the new Prime Minister took office and the start of exchanges among political parties under UN-OAS auspices to put the country under the path to normality.
One of the main points of the agreement was granting Aristide an amnesty.  The terms also talked about international cooperation, consisting of technical aid and assistance, to make administrative and judicial reforms and to modernize armed forces, and UN and OAS verification of full compliance with the agreement.","President Jean-Bertrand Aristide

In Guwahati, on 20 February 1993, the government of Assam and the government of India signed a peace settlement with the militant Bodo group ABSU; one of the groups fighting for greater group rights for the Bodo tribes in the state of Assam.

The settlement stipulated the bringing overground of all ABSU militants, and their subsequent depositing of arms and disbandment. The government of Assam was to initiate immediate steps for suitable rehabilitation, and also provided ex-gratia payments to the next of kin of those killed during the conflict.

The key provisions of the agreement was the establishment of the Bodoland Autonomous Council, comprising 2000 villages and 25 tea plantations in 8 districts of northern and lower Assam. The council should be comprised of 35 elected members, with five more to be nominated by the Governor of Assam from the underrepresented communities. It should act as an assembly for the autonomous area, and secure the ""social, economic, educational, ethnic and cultural advancement of the Bodos residing therein"". Contrary to what the Bodo delegation demanded the council were not given any autonomy with regard to law and order within this territory.

Two problems were highly visible both in the negotiation and implementation phase of the accord. Firstly, there was no consensus on the Bodos demographic strength and extension within the area they demanded autonomy for. Secondly, as the Bodo villages were not contiguous the demarcation of the jurisdiction of BAC remained a problem. The accord provided for all villages having a 50 per cent tribal population into the BAC. For the sake of contiguity, even villages with only one per cent tribal population was included. When the time for implementation came the accord was met by stiff resistance from the Assamese population in these areas.The accord was heavily criticized by the hard-line militants within the Bodo- movement. The Bodo Security Force said its was a betrayal of the Bodo cause,  and had at the time already resumed the violent campaign for a separate state of Bodoland apart from Assam.","K.S.

India will make a special arrangement for the Nagas in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur in return NSCN-IM will drop its demand to merge these areas with Nagaland. 

It was expected that there would be a future final agreement.

It provided for the surrender of the ATTF rebels: to deposit arms and ammunition and surrender all underground activities. In the accord the new left wing government committed itself to take measures for the resettlement and rehabilitation of ATTF personnel; to the eviction of Bengalis, who had arrived after 1971, from the tribal areas; and to the introduction of an inner-line permit system restricting the settlement of Bengalis in Tripura. 

Furthermore, the settlement provided for the inclusion of the tribal majority districts in the Autonomous District Council areas; for the establishment of a village police force under the ADC; and the increase of numbers of seats for the tribal representatives in the ADC. Lastly the parties agreed on several measures to strengthen  and protect the cultural heritage of the tribal population such as language, names and important buildings. Relatively little information is conveyed about the circumstances of the agreement, but it can be noted that the new government that had taken office came from the left-wing party widely accused of being the key force behind the ATTFs campaign of violence initiated in 1991.","For ATTF

The first point in the agreement is a cessation of hostilities, combined with a redeployment of both belligerents’ troops to defensive positions. These defensive positions were agreed upon in a joint commission. The next step in the process was a phased disarmament and demobilizations program, under which the GAM rebels were to place there weapons in prearranged sites and fully disarm within seven months. There was also a partial demilitarization of the Aceh province. Throughout the peace process policing duties and law and order would continue to be the responsibility of the Indonesian police.

The parties further agreed to the acceptance of the NAD law, giving the Aceh province a broad autonomy, but without the authority over policing. The peace process was to be a democratic and inclusive process that would lead up to a democratically elected government for the Aceh province. The parties also agreed that this first settlement would lead to further negotiations, seeing that GAM had not had all of their demands satisfied.

The agreement was signed in Helsinki, Finland, on 15 August 2005 under the mediation and facilitation of former Finnish president Marti Ahtisaari.

The agreement stipulated the demobilization and disbandment of GAM’s 3,000 rebel troops and their reintegration into civilian life. All demobilized combatants are given the right to an employment or to appropriate farmlands. The agreement also restricts the presence of government troops in the region, and calls for a withdrawal of all non-organic forces from Aceh. The police force in Aceh was to be retrained, in order to firmly entrench democratic and human rights values in the doctrine of the forces.

The territorial incompatibility was regulated through an agreement on self-governance for Aceh. Aceh will govern itself in all sectors of public affairs except foreign affairs, external defence, national security, monetary and fiscal matters, justice and freedom of religion. The government of Indonesia was charged with agreeing in consultation on international agreements and legislation that affected the Aceh region. Traditional institutions of Aceh were to be reinstated.

Measures were also agreed upon to legalize the formation of Aceh-based political parties, and to hold elections in 2006 and 2009 for the executive and legislative branches of the Acehnese self-governing entity. Agreement was also reached on the sensitive issue of natural resources; 70% of revenue from the exploitation of these resources would be channeled to the Aceh government.

The Oslo B agreement, or the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, should be viewed as the most important agreement following the 1993 Oslo agreement that begun this peace process.

The agreement stipulated further withdrawals of Israeli forces from the West Bank and Gaza, and the placement of Palestinian security forces in these areas.The terms of the Interim Agreement also stipulated the extension of the Palestinian power to include six more West Bank towns, including parts of Hebron, within six months. It further stated that Palestinian National Authority was to be extended over most of the West Bank by late 1997. The powers of the Council were increased and allowed the Palestinian Authority to conclude agreements with other states in some political spheres, and more importantly allowed the PA to pass both primary and secondary legislation.

As a confidence building measure Israel agreed to release prisoners and detainees that were residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Some refugees from these areas that were located abroad were also allowed to return, and would not be charged for crimes committed before the Oslo agreement in 1993.

The agreement contains: Annex I- Protocol Concerning Redeployment and Security Arrangements, Annex II- Protocol Concerning Elections, Annex III- Concerning Civil Affairs, Annex IV- Protocol Concerning Legal Affairs, Annex V- Protocol on Economic Relations, Annex VI- Protocol Concerning Israeli ­Palestinian Cooperation Programs, and Annex VII- Release of Palestinian Prisoners and Detainees. 

In combination, the annexes address the incompatibility by regulating the border issue, though not resolving the greater issue of power and territory. These annexes are part of the Oslo II peace process. Parts regulate interactions and sharing of boundaries between Israel and Palestine, provide a pathway for election of representatives to local governance bodies for Palestine, provides for transfer of various civil powers from the Israeli military and civil administration to the Palestinian Council, and create programs in the interest of striving for peaceful coexistence through economic, scientific, social, and cultural areas for cooperation. Discussion on permanent status was reserved for future negotiations. The annexes also included redeployment and security arrangements to be implemented during the interim period, various issues having to do with civil affairs, and release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.","Yitzhak RABIN

The end result of the international conference in Annapolis was this peace process agreement, dubbed the ""Israeli-Palestinian Joint Understanding on Negotiations"".

The agreement was a peace process agreement in its true sense, containing only a pledge to continue negotiations on the core issues of the conflict and a time table for these negotiations.

Both parties pledged to end incitement to bloodshed and violence, and to initiate bilateral negotiations on ""all outstanding issues"", as specified in earlier agreements. In essence, this peace process agreement is therefore a continuance of the peace process that ended with the start of the Second Intifada.

Further, the parties agreed to conclude a final and comprehensive peace agreement before the end of 2008, through negotiations in a steering committee and through bi-weekly meetings between Abbas and Olmert.

Finally, both parties pledged to implement their respective obligations under the ""Road Map for Peace"", issued by the Quartet in 2003. A joint mechanism, chaired by the USA is to monitor the extent to which the parties fulfill their obligations.","PLO Chairman and PNA President Muhammad Abbas

Ten delegations and 32 representatives were present, including representatives of Gbagbos government, Guillaume Soro of the MPCI, representatives of western rebel groups MPIGO and MJP, as well as the major Ivorian political parties and Alassane Ouattara.

The agreement reaffirms the Lomé ceasefire agreement, which was made possible through the deployment of French and ECOWAS forces. It was further stipulated that immediately after taking office the Government of National Reconciliation would undertake the process of regrouping its forces under French and ECOWAS supervision. In a second phase measures would be taken to disarm and demobilize all of the forces in the conflict, also under French and ECOWAS supervision. The agreement briefly outlined a DDRRR program for the social reintegration of the combatants. The Government of National Reconciliation was also charged with rebuilding a national army and a national security force, but there was no mention of rebel integration into these forces.

The incompatibility was regulated through the agreement on establishing a Government of National Reconciliation, which would be based on a power-sharing arrangement between the parties in the conflict. The government would be composed of persons selected by those parties taking part in the Round Table discussions. An electoral timetable was also to be prepared to facilitate credible and transparent elections.

Further agreements were made on a plan for the reconstruction of the country and the release and amnesty for all detained military personell that had not committed seriuous human rights violations.In the subsequent African heads of state summit in Paris (Kleber summit), held on 25 – 26 January, regional West African leaders and heads of state ratified the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord.

The accord  provided for the merger of the forces of the government and the FN and the deployment of mixed patrols in the former “zone of confidence” that had separated the government-controlled south from the north of Ivory Coast, occupied by the FN. It also included provisions for the identification of the population, the establishment of a green line observed by the United Nations as replacement of the area formerly covered by the “zone of confidence”; the disarmament of militias and their reintegration through civic service programmes; amnesty for crimes committed since September 2000.

Regarding the incompatibility the agreement provided for the organisation of open and transparent presidential elections to be held after the conclusion of the identification and registration process of eligible voters. Until the elections a government of transition would administrate the country.  Full implementation was envisioned to be accomplished by 4 January 2008.

The agreement provided for the disarmament of all national and non national militias.

Regarding the incompatibility the agreement provided for powersharing involving the major politico-religious-ethnic groups in Lebanon. The Chamber of Deputies was increased in size to 128 members, shared equally between Christians and Muslims. A cabinet was established similarly divided equally between Christians and Muslims. The agreement also enhanced the powers of the Prime Minister (Sunni) over those of the president (Christian).

The Taif agreement located Lebanon as Arab in belonging and identity. The agreement covered the relationship between Lebanon and Syria. The agreement stipulated the withdrawal of all Syrian troops to the Beqaa valley by 2 years during which they would assist Lebanon to spread the authority of the state. The agreement did not provide a time frame for their full withdrawal of the country.

Once confined to these locations ECOMOG would commence disarmament of all combatants. Further ECOMOG was to draw up a 30 km buffer zone to separate the belligerents from one another.

The incompatibility was regulated through a preliminary agreement on the administration of the country by an interim government up until elections.

The signing of the Cotonou agreement should be seen as a considerable move forward in the Liberian peace process. The parties agreed on a number of issues, most importantly on the modalities and specifications for the transitional government that had been set forth early on in the process.

The first point was the establishment of a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by ECOMOG. The troops involved in the fighting were to remain in their locations until the commencement of encampment and subsequent demobilization. The parties expressed their willingness to disarm, and called upon the international community for financial aid for such a process.

The most important deal however was struck when the parties agreed to the composition and mandate of the Transitional Government. This transitional regime would enjoy full authority over the Liberian territory and contained a number of power-sharing arrangements in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The executive would be composed of a five member Council of State, the delegates chosen by ‘prominent Liberians’. The Transitional Assembly would be comprised of delegates from the government (13 members), the NPFL (13 members) and ULIMO (9 members). ULIMO were also granted the right to nominate one delegate to the Supreme Court. Power-sharing was also present in the formation of en Elections Commission, charged with working towards the holding of general elections.

Also, a general amnesty was declared, and a program for the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons was initiated, along with a release of all prisoners of war. Disarmament of the warring factions was impeded because of inter-factional fighting","Amos Claudius Sawyer

Ghana agreed to host talks in Accra which resulted in a ceasefire agreement signed on 17 June 2003 called “Agreement on Ceasefire and Cessation of Hostilities Between the Government of the Republic of Liberia and Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia”. This was primarily a ceasefire agreement, but it can neverthless be seen as a peace process agreement since it outlined a process for how to regulate a number of issues related to the incompatibility. The warring parties committed themselves to refrain from any act that might constitute a violation of the agreement, and an ECOWAS joint verification team was to be set up. In addition, a joint monitoring committee (ECOWAS, UN, African Union and the ICGL) would monitor the ceasefire. The parties agreed on the need for the deployment of an international stabilization force in Liberia. The warring parties, political parties and stakeholders would engage in dialogue to seek within 30 days a lasting peace agreement. The agreement would cover disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, restructuring of the Liberian security forces, human rights and reconciliation and the formation of a transitional government, not to include President Charles Taylor. The transitional government should prepare the ground for general elections.","The Ceasefire Agreement in Accra, Ghana was signed by Hon. Daniel L. Chea Snr.

The peace agreement, signed at Accra in Ghana, provides for a transitional power-sharing government called the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) to be installed on 14 October 2003, and its mandate would run until January 2006.

The parties reaffirmed the earlier ceasefire and agreed to a national process of cantonment, disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration of the armed forces. It was stipulated that a new national army would be created, comprised of combatants from all of the parties and any civilians with the appropriate background and experience. A restructuring of the security forces would also commence once the cantonment process had ended, creating a National Police Force, an Immigration Force, a Special Security Service, custom security guards and other statutory security units. ECOMOG was to establish a multinational peacekeeping force to preserve the peace.

A Transitional Government was established under the agreement, and will enjoy full authority over the unified country. The Transitional Government was one of power-sharing, assuring the warring factions, the political parties and civil society a specific number of seats in the unicameral assembly. The new government would consist of 76 members: 12 each from the three warring parties; 18 from political parties; seven from civil society and special interest groups; and one from each of Liberia’s 15 counties. The warring parties, the opposition parties and civil society groups will share ministerial portfolios and employment opportunities in the cabinet and parliament. Elections were to be held no later than 2005.

Agreements were also reached on the repatriation of refugees and IDP’s, on a recommendation for a general amnesty and the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.","The Accra Peace Agreement was signed on 18 August 2003, by all three warring parties, the Government of the Republic of Liberia (GOL), the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Reconciliation and Democracy (MODEL).

The peace agreement provided for greater rights for the ethnic Albanian community. Constitutional changes were to be made on a number of aspects: members of the minority groups, such as the Albanians, were to be referred to as Macedonian citizens and Albanian was given status of official language in areas where speakers constituted 20% of the population. Furthermore, Albanians were given the right to proportional representation in the judiciary, all areas of government administration and security forces. Greater rights were also provided for as for national and local politics, education and state employment. The double majority method was adopted, whereby legislation affecting minorities required not only a majority of parliamentary votes, but also a majority of votes of those deputies who were not members of the ethnic majority.

The agreement was signed in Tamanrasset, Algeria, on 6 January 1991.

The first point in the agreement was a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities. The ceasefire did not contain any territorial concessions; instead the forces of the warring parties were to remain in their present locations. For the rebels this meant a continued occupation of northern Mali. At a later stage the North would be completely demilitarized through a phased withdrawal. The agreement provided for a demobilization and subsequent integration into the armed forces for the rebels. It was also agreed that the armed forces of Mali would not have the mandate to interfere in internal political activities. The ceasefire would be monitored by a joint commission, which would include Algeria, the mediator in this conflict.

Internal autonomy was to be granted to the Adrar region (i.e. Gao and Timbuktu); and additional state funds were to be allocated to the development of the region.

The agreement was signed by MNLA, which later became part of CMA in June 2014. According to UCDP coding rules, MNLA therefore had a name change to CMA. For this reason, this peace agreement is coded as being signed between the Government and CMA.

Voter turnout was however low in the Kidal area, estimated by the election commission at 12 percent in the district. After a second round run-off held on 11 August, former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta was declared winner and new president of Mali. His election was cautiously welcomed by the Tuareg rebels, with Sidi Mohammed Ag Sarid, homeland security spokesman for MNLA saying that “he may be the man for the job, given his past. … He has never been responsible for acts that have harmed Azawad.""

On the ground the ceasefire was fragile, however. MNLA fighters – stipulated in the accord to be cantoned in camps – came and went, citing a lack of electricity, food and water in the cantonment areas. Meetings between them and government troops were reported to be tense, with each side flying its own flag, accusing the other of provocation.

In late September MNLA withdrew from the peace process, accusing Bamako of not respecting its commitments to the truce. Only days later, the parties clashed in Kidal. However, on 5 October the rebels once more announced that they were in favor of resumed peace talks. In late October the president asked a national congress to draw up plans for increased regional autonomy, stating that northern Tuaregs had legitimate concerns that should be addressed but insisted that demands for independence were unacceptable.

The deadline for the initiation of inclusive peace talks expired at the beginning of November without any formal process having been launched. During the rest of the year, it was reported that contacts between the parties continued, but through informal channels. It was also reported that the atmosphere was becoming increasingly tense.

On 20 June 2015, the main rebel actor CMA added its signature to Accord for peace and reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process (Accord pour la paix et la réconciliation au Mali issu du processus d’Alger).  The agreement provides for political and security reforms, including a framework for greater representation in the National Assembly. It also provides for a UN peacekeeping operation in Mali, MINUSMA, and for DDR processes. 

The agreement was the product of a negotiation process that had commenced in September 2014 and where two main camps had emerged among the armed rebel forces: CMA and Platform. The former includes MNLA and number of other pro-independence groupings, whereas the latter is made up of movements that seek national unity. 

The Accord for peace and reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process was signed by the government and Platform, as well as by two minor groups from the CMA umbrella, on 15 May. However, the bulk of CMA refused to sign the accord in the light of events on the ground. A couple of weeks earlier, Platform groups had ousted CMA from the important town Menaka, and the separatists demanded that Platform withdraw from the town before they would consider signing the accord. On 18 June, Platform agreed to this demand, and, subsequently, on 20 June the remainder of CMA agreed to the accord. 

With regard to the incompatibility, the Agreement aims to deal with the basic causes of the conflict and to achieve national reconciliation and unity. It recognizes and addresses territorial integrity and the need to incorporate ethnic, cultural, and territorial diversity in the peace process, service delivery, and in governance systems. 

In addition to the political and security reforms, the Agreement also includes provisions for national reconciliation and broad sustainable regional development, addressing cultural, economic, health, and infrastructure needs. Humanitarian provisions include addresses return of refugees and displaced persons. ","For the Government of the Republic of Mali:

The Acordo Geral de Paz (General Peace Agreement) was signed in Rome, which was also the location for the twelve rounds of negotiations leading up to the signing of the accord. The General Peace Agreement formed a whole with a number of previous protocols signed by the government and RENAMO and finalized the peace process.

A ceasefire was to come into place after its ratification by the assembly, under which a phased cessation of hostilities was stipulated. The cessation of hostilities begins with a ceasefire but closes with both forces withdrawing from their present positions to encampment sites where they will subsequently be chosen for integration into the new armed units, or effectively demobilized. The final agreement contained a military pact, which stipulated that a new army consisting of 30 000 men would be established, with each party contributing 15,000 men each. The remainders of the forces were to be disarmed and demobilized under UN supervision within six months.

The main regulation of the incompatibility was the already stipulated transformation of RENAMO into a political party and the holding of free multi-party elections (regulated in Protocol II). Presidential and legislative elections were to take place under UN supervision one year after the signing of General Peace Agreement, provided that it had been fully implemented and the demobilization process completed.

The agreement also called for a donor conference, with the goal of raising funds for the demobilization process, the electoral process and the reconstruction of the country. Further, all prisoners were to be released and all refugees and IDP’s were allowed to return freely and voluntarily to the country.","For the government of Mozambique: President Joaquim Chissano

The Bougainville Peace Agreement was a comprehensive agreement detailing both the short- and long-term issues that needed to be targeted to end the conflict.

Under the agreement reached the PNG military were to withdraw from the area, and all future activities in Bougainville would be cooperative after consultation with the autonomous government. The weapons disposal program developed in May 2001 was also incorporated unchanged into the Agreement. It would create a high level of autonomy for the region of Bougainville, where a democratic and accountable system of government would be established and institutionalized through a future Bougainville Constitution. Powers and functions were to be divided between the National Government and the autonomous Bougainville government, with PNG mainly being responsible for foreign affairs-related issues and communications. Amongst other things, Bougainville would become fiscally self-reliant in such a way that tax income from the area should be equal to the recurrent grants from the government.The long-term settlement of the political status of Bougainville would be resolved through a referendum 10-15 years after the election of the first autonomous Bougainville government, and after the fulfilment of a list of pre-set conditions. International observers would be invited to make sure the election would be free and fair.","Mekere Morauta (PNG Prime Minister)

The Arusha Accords were signed 4 August 1993. It lasted less than a month - the implementation of the peace agreement was prepared, but never fulfilled. The Arusha Accords comprised a general agreement and six attached protocols that were all combined into a whole to form this comprehensive agreement.

The first point of interest in the agreement was the parties reaffirming the N´Sele Ceasefire Agreement, which instated a Neutral Corridor separating the warring parties from each other. The corridor, and the observance of the ceasefire, was to be monitored by the Neutral Military Observer Group. A unified national army was stipulated, and the government was to contribute 60% of the forces and the FPR 40%. The same formula was applied for the police force, and all other types of uniformed forces. The military pact was of an extensive nature, with military power-sharing also applied to military training schools and other facilities. The combatants that would not be integrated were to become subject to a DDR program which included demobilization allowances and social, economic and educational training.

A power-sharing arrangement was agreed upon in the political sphere to resolve the incompatibility. The president and prime minister were to be chosen through a process of consensus, ministerial portfolios were distributed between all the participating parties (with the FPR receiving five such portfolios) and the seats in the assembly were to be shared according to a similar formula (the FPR being granted 11 seats). The new Prime Minister was to be installed by 10 September. Multiparty general elections were to take place after a 22-month period, during which the power-sharing arrangements would be in force.

Finally, the agreement allowed for repatriation of all Rwandan refugees and the return of internally displaced persons to their homes. The CDR, an extremist party which broke out from the MRND, and which claimed to represent the interests of the Hutu majority, refused to participate in any future Assembly.","Major-General Justenal Habyarimana President of the Republic of Rwanda

A peace agreement was signed on 30 November 1996 in Abidjan between the government of Sierra Leone and RUF.

The agreement stipulated a cessation of hostilities and a number of reforms for the armed forces. The Commission for the Consolidation of Peace was to make recommendations for the restructuring of the armed forces and the selection of commanding officers. Rebels could be integrated into these reconstructed forces, but inclusion hinged on combatants being acceptable to certain criteria to be worked out by the Commission. Provisions were also made for the resettlement and rehabilitation of those combatants who were not integrated.

This commission was to establish a number of subcommittees charged with consolidating the peace and instituting programs for the reconstruction of the country. The Commission also had the power to make preliminary legislative drafts necessary for the implementation of the peace agreement.

Political reforms included the restructuring of the National Electoral Commission, and the transformation of the RUF/SL into a legal political party that would enjoy freedom of the press, access to the media and other democratic rights. National resources would be distributed equitably between all citizens and provisions were also made for political reforms to rid the country of extreme poverty and starvation.

The Togolese city of Lomé was the venue for the signing of this peace agreement on 7 July 1999. The government of Sierra Leone and RUF both took part, but the AFRC were not included in the talks.

The first point in the agreement was a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities, to be monitored by a committee chaired by UNOMSIL and participated in by the government and RUF. A new national army is to be constructed, drawing on those combatants that fulfill the established criteria for integration. An extensive DDR program is established, with financial payments and benefits for those demobilized and a committee for the purpose of retraining ex-combatants for civilian duties and social reintegration.

The peace agreement was signed on 27 March 1993 in Addis Ababa.

In the agreement the parties firstly committed themselves to a previously signed ceasefire agreement, and to complete  disarmament through the handover of weapons to UNITAF/UNOSOM (the multinational United Task Force that was transformed into the UN Operation in Somalia). A restructuring of the national police force would commence, in order to create an impartial national and regional police force.

Secondly, the parties agreed to set up a Transitional National Council (TNC) and three other transitional organs, for a period of two years, that would eventually lead to democratic governance, the rule of law, decentralisation of power, and the protection of human rights and individual liberties. The TNC would have legislative functions during the transition period, and it would further establish an independent judiciary. It would be composed of representatives from all regions in Somalia and all political factions that participated in the National Reconciliation Conference (and consequently signed the agreement). Moreover, Central Administrative Departments, Regional Councils and District Councils would be established. Hence, the incompatibility of government was given a solution through this agreement.","Mohammed Qanyare Afrah (government), Gen. Mohammed Farah H Aideed (USC faction), Mohamed R.

The 19 August 2008 marks the official signing of a 9 June political agreement between the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS).

The agreement provides for the cessation of hostilities within 30 days and the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops, a question at the core of the conflict incompatibility. The parties agreed to request that the United Nations (UN) deploy an international stabilisation force within 120 days. The agreement also provided for the establishment of a High Level Committee, to pursue issues of political cooperation between the parties, as well as a Joint Security Committee, to develop and follow up the implementation of security arrangements.

The Djibouti Agreement followed two rounds of talks, and was the first in a series of cooperation documents and agreements. In accordance with the Djibouti Agreement, a third round of talks took place on 25-26 October 2008, resulting in two political documents based on the work of the Joint Security and High Level committees. “Modalities for the Cessation of Hostilities between the TFG and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS)” drafted arrangements for a ceasefire to become effective on 5 November, the relocation of Ethiopian troops deployed to Somalia, the impending transition of security-related tasks from Ethiopian troops first to AMISOM forces and later to the anticipated UN force to Somalia, as well as including the first modalities for a joint TFG/ARS security force. A second political document, the “Joint Declaration on the Government of National Unity and the Expanded Parliament”, reiterated the commitment to political cooperation on behalf of the parties. 

However, discrepancies between the parties of the talks and the actors on the ground made the implementation of political progress difficult. In fact, the peace proceedings that had intended to marginalise hard-liners with a broad-based coalition of moderates caused rifts on both sides. As a consequence, agreements forged in the talks had little bearing for the developments on the ground.","The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the Alliance for Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS)

In line with the peace process launched with the 19 August 2008 Djibouti Agreement, a fourth round of talks began on 22 November 2008. The talks resulted in a power-sharing deal between the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and the Alliance for Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS). The agreement provided a framework for the establishment of a Unity Government, consisting of members drawn from both the TFG and the ARS. 

The parties agreed to expand the parliament with an additional 200 seats for ARS-members, as well as with 75 seats allotted to members of the Somali civil society, including women as well as members of the Somali diaspora and business community. A UN-facilitated working group was established in order to develop detailed plans for structures for the Unity Government, which it would submit to the High Level Committee, established through the Djibouti Agreement. 

In order to accommodate the changes necessary in line with this agreement and others, the parties agreed the new provisions would be embedded in the Transitional Federal Charter as amendments. The Transitional Period was extended for an additional two years, starting from August 2009. Thus, the 26 November agreement advanced the Somali peace process through settling part of the incompatibility, but its limitation to the transitional period renders it a partial peace agreement.","Ahmed Abdisalaan Adan of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Abdirahman A.

At CODESA’s first meeting on 20 December, a Declaration of Intent was signed by the participating parties.

With regards to regulation of armed behaviour, the Declaration of Intent made no detailed provisions but affirmed the goal to create “a climate conducive to peaceful constitutional change by eliminating violence, intimidation and destabilization”.

Following a crisis in the peace process in June 1992, when ANC withdrew from CODESA (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) following a massacre of ANC supporters in Boipatong township near Johannesburg, a series of talks were held between Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer (chief negotiators for the ANC and the government, respectively). These talks, aiming at removing the obstacles to further constitutional talks and addressing issues unresolved in previous bilateral talks, culminated in a Record of Understanding signed by Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk on 26 September.
 
The Record of Understanding addressed the ongoing factional violence which constituted a main obstacle to a resumption of negotiations. With this in mind, and based on the findings of the Goldstone Commission which had been set up to investigate the ongoing violence, the government undertook to address the causes identified such as particular urban hostels. The agreement also established a ban on the public display and carrying of dangerous weapons. 

With regards to regulating the incompatibility, the parties reaffirmed the need for a democratically elected constitution-making body. 

Finally, the agreement addressed details regarding the character of the transitional period, namely that the democratically elected interim parliament should be the constitution-making body; that this parliament could have one or two chambers; and that there should be a transitional government of national unity.","For the government: President FW de Klerk

Following several months of deadlock after CODESA (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) collapsed in June 1992, multiparty negotiations on a new constitution resumed in April 1993. This time negotiations took place under the banner of the Multiparty Negotiating Process (MPNP), attended by delegations from 26 political groups. On 18 November the multiparty negotiation delegates announced agreement on an interim constitution. 

All the signatory parties rejected violence and promised to work for a free and fair election process. The interim constitution stipulated the creation of a single, unified army and police force, in line with the overarching principle of equality between races and genders. 

The interim constitution fully resolved the incompatibility between ANC and the government of South Africa. It provided for a proportionally elected National Assembly and a Senate representing the nine provinces. There would be a Government of National Unity made up of the parties gaining at least 5 % of the vote, with those parties getting one seat in the government for every 5 % of the vote it obtained. The president would be elected by the National Assembly, and there would also be at least two Deputy Presidents. The National Assembly and the Senate were together responsible for establishing the final constitution, which would have to enshrine a number of principles drawn up in the constitutional negotiations; they included provisions for a unitary state, a multiparty democracy, universal human rights, checks and balances on state power, and an independent judiciary. 

The interim constitution also included a timetable for implementation and elections, and a definition of the new administrative divisions of South Africa. Furthermore, it included a clause on amnesty for all “acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past”, instructing the future transitional government to decide on a proper mechanism to deal with this issue. The Interim Constitution was adopted as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993, and was in force from 27 April 1994 until it was replaced by the final constitution, adopted by the democratically elected national assembly, on 18 December 1996.",,"The interim constitution was agreed the parties to the Multiparty Negotiating Process (MPNP), which included the government and ANC.

With regards to regulation of armed activity, the proposal stipulated confinement to bases of South African and SWAPO troops, a gradual reduction of South African troops in the territory to 1500, and a transitional process controlled jointly by South Africa and the UN. The agreement also stipulated demobilisation of local armies. Immediately after the adoption by the UN of the plan, on “D-Day”, a ceasefire would begin, the warring parties would be confined to bases, and the UN force would take charge over security. Over 12 weeks from “D-Day”, the South African forces would be cut back from some 20-40 000 to 1500. 

Concerning the incompatibility, the agreement outlined a process for free and fair elections leading to independence for Namibia. The South African Administrator-General would remain in Namibia and administer the elections, but the process would be supervised by a Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and a 5000-strong UN Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) would secure order during the transition period. A week after the South African forces were reduced to 1500, the election campaign would begin, and one week after the Special Representative had certified the elections South Africa would withdraw completely and the new government would be installed. The date for independence was envisaged for 31 December 1978.

The agreement also stipulated return of refugees, release of political prisoners, and abolition of apartheid policies. The UN endorsed the agreement through a succession of resolutions in July-September 1978. In UNSCR 431 on 27 July, the Security Council requested the Secretary General to appoint a Special Representative and take other steps necessary to begin implementation of the independence plan. Another resolution, UNSCR 432, on the same day outlined the UN’s position that Walvis Bay was an integral part of Namibia (the issue of Walvis Bay had been left outside of the Settlement Proposal, a fact both parties had accepted). Martti Ahtisaari was afterwards appointed as the Special Representative. On 29 September, the Security Council in UNSCR 435 definitely established the independence plan.",,"The agreement was not established in the form of a traditional peace agreement, but rather the parties declared their agreement with the Settlement Proposal which was then definitely established through the passing of UNSCR 435.","Western Contact Group (WCG), United Nations (UN)","The Settlement Proposal was mediated by the Western Contact Group (WCG), comprising the Western members of the UN Security Council; USA, UK, Canada, France and West Germany.

This is a partial agreement, part of the Machakos process, and attempts to regulate the incompatibility through establishing a power-sharing regime in the Sudan.There are three arrangements within the protocol that stand out as the most important. The first is the establishment of an interim constitution, the second the creation of a Government of Southern Sudan and the third is a power-sharing arrangement at the central government level of the Sudan.The establishment of a Government of Southern Sudan is for the interim period only, and should be seen as autonomy arrangement with the GOS having a somewhat lower level of authority than the central government of Sudan, but still with a legislative assembly and executive powers. In the legislature of Southern Sudan the SPLM will have 70% of the seats, and the ruling Khartoum party (NCP) 15%. Other Southern Sudan political forces receive 15% of the seats. The same formula is applied to the executive authority of Southern Sudan. The GOS is also given the right to control its own police and security forces.At the national level a power-sharing arrangement was brokered, which meant that the SPLM leader John Garang was appointed first Vice-President and that a formula of 52% of seats for the NCP and 28% of seats for the SPLM was applied to the National Assembly.The two governments will deal with the issue of resettlement of refugees and IDP’s in concert.","The Government of Sudan and SPLM/A.

It calls for abolishing emergency laws and statutes restricting freedoms, establishing new laws for Sudanese political parties, methods of allowing for power sharing and the dissolution of NDA forces.

After months of protracted negotiations following on the peace process agreement signed between the two parties in Cairo in January 2005 the Government of Sudan and the NDA signed another peace agreement in Cairo on 18 June 2005.

The peace agreement is linked to the agreement signed the same year by the GoS and the SPLM, calling for power- and wealth sharing for Sudan (9 January 2005), and binds the two settlements together. It covers a wide-range of issues, but does not completely specify its power-sharing and military aspects.

The agreement stipulates that Sudan will be a multiparty non-confessional democracy with equal rights for all citizens and be open to all political parties. The NDA, previously being banned and in exile, are allowed to return to Sudan to conduct democratic politics and will take part in the drafting of the new Sudanese constitution as stipulated in the 9 January 2005 comprehensive peace agreement. It further binds the NDA to taking part in the Interim Government of Unity and the federal decentralization process in the interim time period of six years. The state of emergency is to be lifted to allow for a democratic transition throughout the interim period leading up to free and fair multiparty elections.

Further, the peace agreement commits the two parties to form a number of commissions, for example a constitutional, a political and a military committee, to discuss implementation of the peace agreement. The civil servant forces and the national armed forces are to be restructured on the basis of equality for all the peoples of Sudan.

The agreement however does not specify the exact number/quota of NDA participation in the Government of National Unity, or the exact fate of the NDA’s military forces. These issues are instead placed within the mandate of two committees that are to work out these details during the course of more negotiations. In October and November 2005 the NDA joins the Government of National Unity and the parliament of Sudan following discussions on these issues.","For the GoS: President Omar Al-Bashir

On 5 May 2006 the Government of Sudan and the SLM/MM (Minni Mannawi faction) signed a peace agreement concerning the three states of Darfur, in the Nigerian city of Abuja. The agreement contains a total of 6 annexes, all which are reaffirmed. The peace agreement was meant to be signed by SLM/AW and JEM as well as SLM/MM, but the two former groups refused to sign, leading to the peace agreement mentioning all groups, but applying only to SLM/MM.

This dyadic peace agreement, being wide in scope, covered such issues as national and state power-sharing, demilitarization of the Janjaweed and other militias, an integration of SLM/A and JEM troops into the Sudanese Armed Forces and police, a system of federal wealth-sharing for the promotion of Darfurian economic interests, a referendum on the future status of Darfur and measures to promote the flow of humanitarian aid into the region.

The agreement contained a comprehensive ceasefire agreement (CFA), which reaffirmed in particular the NDajema Agreement of April 2004. The CFA forbade mobilization, recruitment, military actions and propaganda, and stipulated the release of all detainees. It also contained measures to protect humanitarian aid routes and IDPs. The CFA was to be monitored and verified mainly by AMIS, whose force strength was to be enhanced by international partners. An important part of the CFA was the neutralization of the Janjaweed and the Popular Defence Forces, for which the GoS was responsible. The agreement stipulated that the GoS was to take all measures available to neutralize the threat posed by these groups operating in GoS territory. Disengagement, redeployment and demobilization were sequenced according to a step-by-step plan according to a specified time-frame.

The chapter on Final Security Arrangements outlined the final moves for demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. Forces of SLM/A and JEM were to be integrated into the security institutions of Sudan, with a total of 4000 soldiers being integrated into the armed forces, 1000 being integrated into the police and another 3000 being given professional and educational training for reintegration into civilian life. Integrated battalions were to be composed of between 33% and 50% SLM/A or JEM troops. Senior positions in SAF command and HQ were also to be granted to the movements, at a total of 20%. The agreement further stipulated reforms of various security institutions, for instance the Border Intelligence Units, the Popular Defence Forces and the Popular Police, in order to increase equitable representation and professionalism.

Regarding the incompatibility the agreement both touched on political representation and the future status of Darfur. In the political sphere the most important provisions were power-sharing at the national and state level, the creation of a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority (TDRA), a referendum and general moves towards the equitable representation of Darfurians in Sudanese affairs. Up until elections, i.e. in the interim period, the SLM/A and JEM would be represented at the national level by a Senior Assistant to the President, to be selected from a list of nominees by these two movements. This Senior Assistant was to be placed at the head of a number of councils and committees in order to ensure influence over national policy. Further, the 3 posts of Cabinet Minister held by Darfurians would remain, and an additional Cabinet Minister and 2 posts of State Minister would be allocated to SLM/A and JEM nominees. 12 seats in the legislative would also be awarded to such nominees. Power-sharing arrangements were also agreed upon within Darfur, with the seat of Governor of 1 of the 3 Darfurian states to be held by a SLM/A and JEM nominee, and with 2 seats of Deputy Governor in all other states. Ministerial positions were also to be given to these movements, along with 21 seats out of the 66 seat legislatures of the three states. Lastly, the GoS was to ensure the fair and equitable representation of Darfurians in the national judiciary and civil services. The TDRA would be responsible in the interim period for certain aspects of the implementation process, with the responsibility also of recommending national and state legislation to enhance cooperation and coordination. Pending elections 6 SLM/A nominees and 6 JEM nominees would run local governments. The permanent status of Darfur would be determined by a referendum, to be held no later than July 2010. In this referendum the two alternatives would be; 1) the creation of a unified Darfur region, or 2) status quo with 3 existing Darfurian states (north, south and west). 

On wealth-sharing and fiscal redistribution the peace agreement stipulated a complex structure of federal fiscal relations, with the general aim of fiscal equalization of the Sudanese states. For this purpose Darfur would be given priority in resource redistribution, and also benefit from the Darfur Reconstruction and Development Fund. This part of the agreement also outlined some moves towards land reform, with the affirmation of tribal land ownership and the principal of restitution in cases of lost land. To arbitrate in land disputes the agreement stipulated the creation of a Land Commission, which would make binding decisions on land rights. The distribution of land between different groups, however, was not specifically regulated.

The GoS, the TDRA and international partners were responsible for the reconstruction of Darfur, and of the creation of conditions susceptible to the voluntary return of refugees and IDPs. AMIS would monitor and patrol humanitarian aid routes and demilitarized IDP camps to ensure the return of IDPs and refugees. The agreement also stipulated a donor conference to accumulate the necessary resources for the reconstruction and development of Darfurs economy.

One of the final provisions was the stipulated holding of a Darfur-Darfur dialogue conference, to which all stakeholders in the conflict would be invited to discuss the conflict, reconciliation, community building and issues of land and natural resources. Such a conference would recommend policy and advise the government on legislation to promote peace and reconciliation.","For the GoS: Dr. Magzoub al-Khalifa

The final peace agreement in Tajikistan’s peace process reaffirmed the earlier protocols, signed between 1995 and 1997, and concluded deals on all outstanding issues.

Extensive reforms of the military and security sector were agreed upon, with UTO rebel fighters being integrated into the national army. Those not integrated were to be the subjects of a DDR program. The agreement also stated that 30% of positions within the law enforcement agencies would be allocated to UTO members. Relocation of the troops and the integration and demobilization process would be monitored by the UN mission, UNMOT.

Political deals centered upon power-sharing in a number of established commission and committees charged with holding democratic elections and to work with the reconciliation in the country. UTO were to be represented in these commissions and committees through an equal number of chairman and co-chairmanships and a representation of 25-50%; the figure varying between the different institutions. The government was to be reformed to include UTO members (30%), and the commissions would agree upon political and electoral reforms to allow for multi-party elections in the future.

Further, a general amnesty was proclaimed and a protocol on refugee issues stated that all refugees and IDPs were to voluntarily return and be assisted in their resettlement.

The Nairobi peace agreement was signed by the military council and NRM on 17 December, following several rounds of talks in Nairobi. 

The accord provided for a ceasefire to be implemented within 48 hours, for a new national army to be formed with 8480 men, comprising 3700 from UNLA, 3580 from NRA and 1200 from the other groups and for the capital to be completely demilitarised.  

Regarding the incompatibility, i.e. who would govern Uganda, the agreement stipulated that a Military Council made up of Gen Tito Okello as chairman and head of state, seven UNLA and seven NRM representatives and five from the smaller groups would rule the country until a national conference could be organised to prepare for an interim government and elections.

The Nairobi Peace Agreement made provisions for the installation of a foreign peace keeping force, composed initially of men from Kenya and Tanzania, and later possibly from Britain and Canada, to monitor the implementation of the agreement. In addition, it stipulated that NRA’s administration in the southwest should be dissolved and that all decrees and appointments made since July 1985 should be reviewed.","General Tito Okello Lutwa, Chairman of the Military Council and Head of state of Uganda; Yoweri Museveni, Chairman of the High Command of NRA.

Regarding the incompatibility, i.e. who would govern Uganda, the agreement stipulated that a government endorsed by the people of Uganda would be established, that the Parliament would be expanded and that a Constituent Assembly would be organized to discuss a new constitution.","On Behalf of the government of Uganda,  President Museveni,

The Agreement on Accountability and Reconciliation between the Government of the Republic of Uganda and the Lords Resistance Army/Movement was the second accord signed within the Juba peace process. The question of accountability had been highly controversial due to the ICC indictments against five top-LRA leaders, including Kony. 

In the accord, the parties agreed to establish a viable national alternative to ICC indictments. The agreement provides for the formation of a domestic legal framework that will function as a substitute for the ICC prosecutions. This is to be complemented by alternative processes like traditional justice. Under the accord, the rebel commanders that are accused of serious crimes will face formal criminal and civil justice proceedings in courts, which can impose as of yet undetermined ""alternative penalties and sanctions"" that will replace existing penalties"". Abuses by the national army are to be pursued in the criminal justice system.","For the Government of Uganda: Dr S Kagoda, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Internal Affairs & Acting Head of the Government of Uganda Delegation

After a long series of negotiations, all eight Northern Irish parties participating in the multi-party talks agreed on the content of the Good Friday Agreement (also called the Belfast Agreement). The first part of the agreement, crucial for the Unionists, stated that Northern Irelands constitutional status could only be changed if a majority of the Northern Irish people so desired. It was decided that a referendum would be held every seventh year to establish whether the majority wished to unite with the Republic of Ireland or not. Next in the agreement were the clauses of Strand One, which included the establishment of a Northern Irish parliamentarian assembly (with mechanisms guaranteeing influence from both catholic and protestant parties) and a coalition government (with both catholic and protestant parties).The clauses of Strand Two of the peace agreement involved the establishment of a North-South Ministerial Council (with representatives from the Irish government and the Northern Irish government) It was mentioned that the council had the right to consider to establish a joint parliamentary forum.The clauses of Strand three established a British-Irish Council (including also representatives from the regional institutions in Northern Ireland). A permanent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was to replace the institutions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.

Apart from the regulation of the constitutional issues, the agreement also read that the paramilitary groups should be disarmed within two years, under the monitoring of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD). Another controversial part of the agreement was the release of those prisoners charged with terrorist acts that belonged to groups that had declared a ceasefire. The IRA issued a statement saying that it would judge the agreement ""against its potential to deliver a just and durable peace"". On 22 May, referenda were arranged in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, on whether or not the peace agreement should be ratified/adopted. More than 71% voted yes in Northern Ireland and the peace agreement could thereby be adopted. Both a majority of the Northern Irish Protestants (51%) and of the Catholics (99%) supported the agreement. In the Republic of Ireland (where the yes percentage was 94,4), a referendum was also arranged on constitutional changes concerning Irelands legal claim on Northern Ireland.","The British-Irish Agreement was signed by: Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern. The Multipary agreement was negotiated by eight Northern Irish parties: the Ulster Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Progressive Unionist Party, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition, the Ulster Democratic Party and Labour","Dyadic peace agreement
Sinn Féin said they needed a ""period of consultation"" with their membership before they could sign the Good Friday Agreement. On 6 May, the Sinn Féin leadership confirmed its support for the peace agreement. As was the case during the negotiations, Sinn Féin was generally seen as a proxy for the IRA. In an IRA statement of 30 April, the group commended the efforts of Sinn Féin. The IRA further said that Sinn Féin could be sure that the IRA desire was to see all republicans engage in the ongoing process in a constructive and positive way. Yet, in the same statement the IRA made clear that any matters affecting the IRA was a matter only to be decided upon by itself.","The US President Bill Clinton, Ireland, George Mitchell, IICD (Independent International Commission on Decommissioning)","George Mitchell was significantly involved in bringing about the peace agreement, chairing the negotiations leading to the agreement. Bill Clinton, President of the USA, promised to visit Northern Ireland if that would help ensure the success of the agreement. President Clinton also issued a statement and personal messages urging people to recognise the opportunities offered by the agreement and to vote yes to its adoption. Ireland had a crucial role in achieving the peace agreement, i.e. by issuing a draft agreement in January. The Irish government/parliament also made sure all preparations were taken to change the part of the constitution concerning Irelands legal claim on Northern Ireland.
According to the peace agreement, the IICD, led by the Canadian John de Chastelain, was tasked to monitor the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.",,,"The peace agreement cannot be considered as ended. None of the parties have stated their wish to give up the agreement. The violence between the parties has also been reduced, apart from a limited number of attacks carried out by breakaway factions of the IRA. Furthermore, most of the clauses of the agreement have been fulfilled. 

On the other hand, there were serious problems with one of the dimensions of the implementation of the agreement. This concerned the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons. Already on 30 April 1998, the IRA issued a statement saying that ""the agreement falls short of presenting a solid basis for a lasting settlement"" and ""let us make it clear that there will be no decommissioning by the IRA"". This approach was recurrent in the following years. At the same time, the IRA confirmed its ""definitive commitment"" to the peace process and at times cooperated with the weapons inspectors. Sinn Féins approach was that nothing in the Good Friday Agreement stipulated that decommission has to occur before an Executive coalition government could be formed. The Unionist parties, on the other hand, rejected the formation of the Executive before the decommissioning started. May 2000 was set as the deadline for the completion of the decommissioning. On 7 August 2001 IRA agreed on a method for decommissioning their weapons arsenal and on 23 October IRA begun the process that was finished on 26 September 2005.   

Between 14 October 2002 and 7 May 2007, the Northern Irish institutions were (for the fourth time) suspended and put under direct rule from London.  

Nevertheless, there were constant efforts to make the peace agreement survive. Several clauses from the agreement have been implemented.

The ceasefire, detailed further in an attached annex, was to be accompanied by a cessation of hostilities in Al Jawf and Mareb, and all armed groups from outside are to withdraw. Military, administrative, and security authorities are to be restructured.
