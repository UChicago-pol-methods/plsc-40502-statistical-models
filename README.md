# PLSC 40502: Data Analysis with Statistical Models (Winter 2023)

## Course description

This course is part of the second year of the Quantitative Methodology sequence in the Department of Political Science. It will introduce students to likelihood and Bayesian inference with a focus on multilevel/hierarchical regression models. The overarching framework of this class is *model-based* inference for description and prediction -- a complement to the *design-based* framework of PLSC 30600 Causal Inference. Students will learn both the theory behind Bayesian modeling as well as how to implement common estimators (e.g. Expectation-Maximization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)) in the _R_ statistical programming language. Applied examples will be drawn from across the political science literature, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of large survey data (e.g. the American National Election Survey (ANES), the Cooperative Election Survey (CES), the European Social Survey (ESS)).
